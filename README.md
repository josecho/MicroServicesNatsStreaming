warning: adding embedded git repository: common

You've added another git repository inside your current repository.
Clones of the outer repository will not contain the contents of
the embedded repository and will not know how to obtain it.
If you meant to add a submodule, use:

git submodule add <url> common

=======

If you added this path by mistake, you can remove it from the
index with:

git rm --cached common

See "git help submodule" for more information.
